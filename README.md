# Community Collective for Homelessness

## A Summary

This is a web app designed with Ruby on Rails for homeless shelters to minimize donation waste and maximizing their storage space by specifically asking benefactors for exactly what they need.

Currently, the app is designed for one shelter to access it and for its local community to support them, and in the future, other communities will be able to use it for their own needs.
