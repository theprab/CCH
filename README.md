# Community Collective for Homelessness

## A Summary

This is a web app designed with Ruby on Rails for homeless shelters to minimize donation waste and maximizing their storage space by specifically asking benefactors for exactly what they need.

Currently, the app is designed for one shelter to access it and for its local community to support them, and in the future, other communities will be able to use it for their own needs.

## Accessing the Site

1. Turn on TCNJ's VPN and run the app with
rails server --binding=*your_server_IP*
2. Access [The Community Collective for Homelessness](http://csc415-server42.hpc.tcnj.edu:3000/)
3. You made it! You should see the home page, and from there, feel free to explore.

There are currently three pages, **Resources**, **Donate Here**, and **Administrative Access**, which requires a login.
